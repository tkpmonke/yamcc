# YAMCC (Yet Another MineCraft Clone)
Yet another minecraft clone... but this one is made by me :D

Written in C99 using OpenGL. The only external dependinces are GLFW and GLEW, but I plan on using [LXWindows](https://github.com/org-lx/lxwindows) and [LXGL](https://github.com/org-lx/lxgl) once I get them to a usable state.
